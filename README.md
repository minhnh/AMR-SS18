Then go to the root folder of your catkin workspace and execute ```catkin_make``` in a terminal. Don't forget to source your workspace.

## 3. Assignments

When solving assignments please use the following guidelines:

* Write readable code, this includes proper names for variables (e.g. wheel_speed_left instead of wsl) and functions (e.g. getDistanceToObstacle() instead of distance())
* Follow the Python naming conventions ([Google Python Style Guide], [Python Style Guide])
* Use short and descriptive commit messages (not like [this])
* Commit frequently, don't commit the whole assignment in one go
* Use a [git branching model], don't work on your master branch directly
* Make sure to merge all your changes into the master branch before the deadline. Grading is based on your master branch at the time of the deadline. No late submissions.
* Repositories are private to prevent plagiarism, if two people have the same code they'll both receive 0 points for the assignment
